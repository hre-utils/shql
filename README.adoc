json based database for 'log', instead of a flat text file
realistically we'd want a noSQL model, but I don't think we can do that.

each application is a key in the database, properties being
   * log[], general sequential Note(s)
      * Note[datetime, text]
   * additions[], config files, cron jobs, things that will need to be
     removed on exit

can actually bake in the config file management of `conf` by just looking
at a `conf{name->path, ...}` dict. Then call conf app.name, or if there's
only one present, it uses that entry.

Write my own .json parser.
Seems like a fun thing to do.
JSON -> bash -> JSON.
Only uses dicts and lists, so pretty straightforward.

Does allow me to do things that `jq`/JSON does not, like self-references.
Can have one article refer to another.
