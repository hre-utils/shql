Got myself into a bit of a Catch 22 here.

Need to determine the json hash up front, so it can be passed as a param to both
the json data parser, and the query parser.

However we don't have the full text of the input json until it's read by the
data parser itself.

Can't run it 'til we have it--can't have it 'til we run it.
