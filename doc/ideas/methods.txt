curently we're kinda just interpreting directly off our AST, not really a
problem as the structure is quite simple.

would be good to further compile our method calls and arguments.

anything between '(' ... ')' is appended to the argument list (there will not
be keyword arguments).

each method will have a corresponding function, and validation that the number
and type of arguments matches what is expected.

I do not know how this is done correctly when designing a programming language,
I haven't gotten there yet in the book. :/
